<h1> Bushwick: A Crossroads Between History and Transformation </h1>

	<p> Within the New York lexicon, the term “Brooklynite” refers to a certain brand of beanie-clad twentysomethings who are as steadfast to their aversion to Manhattan as they are to their veganism.However, the neighborhoods that now provide Brooklyn residents their beloved coffee brewers and artisanal shops once housed a very different kind of “Brooklynite.” This is no truer than in Bushwick, a historically Latino neighborhood formerly marked by its steep poverty rate that is now primarily associated with makeshift concert venues and pricey tattoo shops.

	On a chilly Monday evening, the riders of the Canarsie bound L Train begin to taper after its route surpasses Bedford Avenue. At its sixth Brooklyn stop, Herman Morelo steadily guides his wife of 32 years up the ramp to the corner of Morgan Avenue and Harrison Place, just past the tentative East Williamsburg/Bushwick border. The area is adorned with vibrant street art, and the murmurs of spanish speaking passersby fill the air. Bodegas whose storefronts advertise colorful floral bouquets are positioned on every block and  longtime Puerto Rican and Dominican churches coexist with new, handmade clothing shops. The Morelos have lived on Wilson Avenue at St Leonard’s Family Housing for the last 13 years, paying only $300 in rent due to their senior citizen status. “Brooklyn is expensive” Morelo acknowledges. “Most people around here pay $2000 a month for two rooms.” The reason, Morelo suggests, is a drastic “atmosphere change,” that he’s observed throughout his time in Bushwick, aided by an increase of young white residents and a boost in shops and restaurants. However, contrary to the widespread criticism that surrounds the so-called revamping of working class neighborhoods, Herman Morelo considers Bushwick’s new features to be “positive changes” overall, particularly as they relate to minimization of crime. “Before they moved in, there was a big drug scene,” he recalls. “You don’t see that anymore.”

	Sey Coffee, a trendy coffee brewery that opened last fall, is located about four blocks from the Morelo residence at 18 Grattan Street. It has the look of a refurbished warehouse with its open layout and exposed piping. Its still detectable brick walls are painted a striking white and accented with crawling vines and hanging succulent plants. Ambient music reverberates seamlessly through its spacious interior while guests seated on geometric shaped wooden benches type meticulously on their macbooks. A drink menu is perched innocuously atop a utilitarian aluminum countertop, its contents including blends hardly dissectable to a novice coffee drinker such as “La Marimba Colombia” and “Hunkute Ethiopia.” Townhouses are visible through the shop’s glass garage door, the most distinguishable among them boasting a hefty price tag of $1,335,009.

	In Bushwick, the term “Brooklynite” can be easily attributed to the individuals afforded the neighborhood’s inumerable hipster luxuries. However, the face of Bushwick remains multifaceted, and if you look closely, its rich history is still not entirely absent from its streets. As the day draws to a close, construction workers on Morgan Avenue bustle down the steps of the L train station in paint splattered denim and work boots, brushing arms with young people sporting peacoats and iPhone earbuds. What they leave behind is an ambiguous mass of wood that foreshadows yet another unforetold update to the neighborhood of Bushwick.
